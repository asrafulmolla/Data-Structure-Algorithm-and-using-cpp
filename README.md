<h2 align="left">About</h2>
<p>
Data structures are fundamental components of computer science that allow for the organization and storage of data in a way that facilitates efficient access and modification. They are essential for designing and implementing algorithms and play a crucial role in the efficiency of software.</p>
<p>
  Here are some common data structures:
</p>
<p>
 <b>1. Arrays:</b> A collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations, with each element accessible by its index.<br>

<b>Linked Lists:</b> A linear collection of elements, where each element points to the next one in the sequence.<br>

<b>Stacks:</b> A Last In, First Out (LIFO) data structure, where elements are added and removed from the same end, known as the "top."<br>

<b>Queues:</b> A First In, First Out (FIFO) data structure, where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.<br>

<b>Trees:</b> Hierarchical data structures with a root element and branches, where each node has a parent and zero or more children.<br>

<b>Graphs:</b> A collection of nodes connected by edges, allowing for more complex relationships between elements.<br>

<b>Hash Tables:</b> A data structure that maps keys to values, providing efficient data retrieval based on the key.<br>

<b>Heaps:</b> A specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property, often used for priority queues.<br>

<b>Trie:</b> A tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings.<br>

<b>Sets and Maps:</b> Collections that store unique elements, where a set only contains elements, and a map associates keys with values.<br>
